Library Project- 
This is the library project from The Odin Project curriculum. The goal was to create a page where a user 
can store a collection of books, as well as information about those books, and distinguish whether or not
the user has read them already.
This page also stores the current collection of books in the user's local storage, allowing the book data 
to be pulled after a page refresh or a new tab/window.
